## How do I back up my data from Notion?

Let's explore different ways to back up data from Notion:

1. Web scraping creates beautiful backups but is unreliable due to unscrapable fonts/assets, content variations, and UI changes (see: [notionSnapshot](https://github.com/sueszli/notionSnapshot/)).

2. Exporting to markdown can result in data loss compared to HTML as it is not as expressive as HTML.

3. Exporting to HTML works well but requires some tweaking. The exported HTML differs from the Notion app and needs formatting, CSS fixes, and rewriting of file paths for assets.

    <ins>This is where this tool comes in:</ins>

    - unzipping HTML exports
    - formatting minified HTML files (see: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76512571/how-to-unminify-format-html-without-changing-the-formatting))
    - fixing CSS issues (e.g., adjusting code block font size)
    - rewriting certain parts of the HTML (e.g., file names instead of file paths for assets)
